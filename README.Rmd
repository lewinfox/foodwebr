`foodwebr` makes it easy to visualise the dependency graph of a set of functions 
(i.e. who calls who). This can be useful for exploring an unfamiliar codebase, 
or reminding yourself what you wrote ten minutes ago

## Installation

You can install foodwebr from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("lewinfox/foodwebr")
```

## Basic usage

Say we have a bunch of functions in the global environment, some of which call 
each other:

```{r setup}
library(foodwebr)

f <- function() 1
g <- function() f()
h <- function() { f(); g() }
i <- function() { f(); g(); h() }
j <- function() j()
```

A call to `foodweb()` will calculate a graph of the dependencies.

```{r foodweb-basic}
fw <- foodweb()
```

Printing the object will show the [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) 
representation:

```{r foodweb-print}
fw
```

Plotting will draw the graph.

```r
plot(fw)
```

`foodweb()` looks at its calling environment by default. If you want to look at 
another environment you can either pass a function to the `FUN` argument of 
`foodweb()` or pass an environment to the `env` argument. If `FUN` is provided 
then the value of `env` is ignored, and the environment of `FUN` will be used.

### Filtering

If a specific function is passed to `FUN`, the default behaviour is to remove 
functions that are not descendants or antecedents of that function.

```{r foodweb-filter}
# `j()` will not be included
foodweb(FUN = g)

# Force inclusion of unconnected functions by using `filter = FALSE`
foodweb(FUN = g, filter = FALSE)
```

You can use this feature when exploring code in other packages: calling 
`foodweb()` on a function in another package will show you how functions in that 
package relate to each other. I'm using `cowsay` here as it's small enough that 
the output is readable.

By default when calling `foodweb()` on a specific function we only see functions 
that are in the direct line of descendants or antecendents of the specified 
function.

``` r
if (requireNamespace("cowsay", quietly = TRUE)) {
  plot(foodweb(cowsay::say))
}
```

![](man/figures/README-foodweb-plot-package.png)

If we want to include _all_ functions in the package, we can pass 
`filter = FALSE`:

```r
if (requireNamespace("cowsay", quietly = TRUE)) {
  plot(foodweb(cowsay::say, filter = FALSE))
}
```

![](man/figures/README-foodweb-plot-package-no-filter.png)

### Extra `graphviz` options

In case you want to do something with the [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) 
output (make it prettier, for example), you can pass additional arguments to 
`plot()`. These will be passed directly to `DiagrammeR::grViz()`.

### Foodweb as text

```{r foodweb-as-text}
foodweb(as.text = TRUE)
```

Calling `as.character()` on a `foodweb` object will have the same effect.


## Using `tidygraph`

The [`tidygraph`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/) package provides tools 
for graph analysis. A `foodweb` object can be converted into a tidy graph object 
using `tidygraph::as_tbl_graph()` to allow more sophisticated analysis and 
visualisation.

```{r foodweb-tidygraph}
if (requireNamespace("tidygraph", quietly = TRUE)) {
  tg <- tidygraph::as_tbl_graph(foodweb())
  tg
}
```


## See also

`foodwebr` is similar to these functions/packages:

* [`mvbutils::foodweb()`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mvbutils): The OG 
  of function dependency graphs in R, and the inspiration for
  foodwebr. Less user-friendly output, in my opinion.
* [`DependenciesGraphs`](https://github.com/datastorm-open/DependenciesGraphs): 
  Provides much nicer visualisations but does not appear to be actively 
  maintained.
