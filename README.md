# foodwebr

<!-- badges: start -->

`foodwebr` makes it easy to visualise the dependency graph of a set of
functions (i.e. who calls who). This can be useful for exploring an
unfamiliar codebase, or reminding yourself what you wrote ten minutes
ago

## Installation

You can install foodwebr from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("lewinfox/foodwebr")
```

## Basic usage

Say we have a bunch of functions in the global environment, some of
which call each other:

``` r
library(foodwebr)
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'vctrs::data_frame' by 'tibble::data_frame'
#> when loading 'dplyr'

f <- function() 1
g <- function() f()
h <- function() { f(); g() }
i <- function() { f(); g(); h() }
j <- function() j()
```

A call to `foodweb()` will calculate a graph of the dependencies.

``` r
fw <- foodweb()
```

Printing the object will show the [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
representation:

``` r
fw
#> # A `foodweb`: 5 vertices and 7 edges 
#> digraph 'foodweb' {
#>   f()
#>   g() -> { f() }
#>   h() -> { f(), g() }
#>   i() -> { f(), g(), h() }
#>   j() -> { j() }
#> }
```

Plotting will draw the graph.

``` r
plot(fw)
```

`foodweb()` looks at its calling environment by default. If you want to
look at another environment you can either pass a function to the `FUN`
argument of `foodweb()` or pass an environment to the `env` argument. If
`FUN` is provided then the value of `env` is ignored, and the
environment of `FUN` will be used.

### Filtering

If a specific function is passed to `FUN`, the default behaviour is to
remove functions that are not descendants or antecedents of that
function.

``` r
# `j()` will not be included
foodweb(FUN = g)
#> # A `foodweb`: 4 vertices and 6 edges 
#> digraph 'foodweb' {
#>   g() -> { f() }
#>   h() -> { g(), f() }
#>   i() -> { g(), h(), f() }
#>   f()
#> }

# Force inclusion of unconnected functions by using `filter = FALSE`
foodweb(FUN = g, filter = FALSE)
#> # A `foodweb`: 5 vertices and 7 edges 
#> digraph 'foodweb' {
#>   f()
#>   g() -> { f() }
#>   h() -> { f(), g() }
#>   i() -> { f(), g(), h() }
#>   j() -> { j() }
#> }
```

You can use this feature when exploring code in other packages: calling
`foodweb()` on a function in another package will show you how functions
in that package relate to each other. I’m using `cowsay` here as it’s
small enough that the output is readable.

By default when calling `foodweb()` on a specific function we only see
functions that are in the direct line of descendants or antecendents of
the specified function.

``` r
if (requireNamespace("cowsay", quietly = TRUE)) {
  plot(foodweb(cowsay::say))
}
```

<img src="man/figures/README-foodweb-plot-package-1.png" width="100%" />

If we want to include *all* functions in the package, we can pass
`filter = FALSE`:

``` r
if (requireNamespace("cowsay", quietly = TRUE)) {
  plot(foodweb(cowsay::say, filter = FALSE))
}
```

<img src="man/figures/README-foodweb-plot-package-no-filter-1.png" width="100%" />

### `graphviz` as text

In case you want to do something with the
[graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) output (make it prettier, for
example), use `as.text = TRUE`. This returns the graphviz specification
as a character vector.

``` r
foodweb(as.text = TRUE)
#> digraph 'foodweb' {
#>   "f()"
#>   "g()" -> { "f()" }
#>   "h()" -> { "f()", "g()" }
#>   "i()" -> { "f()", "g()", "h()" }
#>   "j()" -> { "j()" }
#> }
```

Calling `as.character()` on a `foodweb` object will have the same
effect.

## Using `tidygraph`

The [`tidygraph`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/) package
provides tools for graph analysis. A `foodweb` object can be converted
into a tidy graph object using `tidygraph::as_tbl_graph()` to allow more
sophisticated analysis and visualisation.

``` r
if (requireNamespace("tidygraph", quietly = TRUE)) {
  tg <- tidygraph::as_tbl_graph(foodweb())
  tg
}
#> # A tbl_graph: 5 nodes and 7 edges
#> #
#> # A directed multigraph with 2 components
#> #
#> # Node Data: 5 x 1 (active)
#>   name 
#>   <chr>
#> 1 f    
#> 2 g    
#> 3 h    
#> 4 i    
#> 5 j    
#> #
#> # Edge Data: 7 x 2
#>    from    to
#>   <int> <int>
#> 1     2     1
#> 2     3     1
#> 3     3     2
#> # … with 4 more rows
```

## How does it work?

Understanding the algorithm is important as there are some key
limitations to be aware of. To identify the relationships between
functions, `foodwebr`:

  - Lists all the functions in an environment.
  - Tokenises the `body()` of each function.
  - Compares each token against the list of function names.
  - If a token matches a function name, (i.e. the name of function B
    appears in the body of function A), records a link from A to B.

This last point leads to the possibility of name masking, where a
function contains an internal variable that matches the name of another
function in the environment. This will lead to a false link.

For example:

``` r
f1 <- function() {
  1
}

f2 <- function() {
  f1 <- 10 # This variable `f1` will be confused with the function `f1()`
  2
}

# The foodweb mistakenly believes that function `f2()` calls function `f1()`
foodweb()
#> # A `foodweb`: 2 vertices and 1 edge 
#> digraph 'foodweb' {
#>   f1()
#>   f2() -> { f1() }
#> }
```

## See also

`foodwebr` is similar to these functions/packages:

  - [`mvbutils::foodweb()`](): The OG of function dependency graphs in
    R, and the inspiration for foodwebr. Less user-friendly output, in
    my
    opinion.
  - [`DependenciesGraphs`](https://github.com/datastorm-open/DependenciesGraphs):
    Provides much nicer visualisations but does not appear to be
    actively maintained.
